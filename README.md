## Summary
<div>
<p>I used canvas to render graphics. I find building this app quite challenging because I have to rethink how the logic for the game gets implemented, like making the snake move. It's not just as simple as DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>Don't you miss playing those 8-bit computer games from the 80s? Anyway, give it a try. Next thing you know you will get addicted in playing these simple games from the past.</p>
